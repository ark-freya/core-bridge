## AIP37 Milestones

This branch contains the height of AIP37 (switch vote) activation for various networks. Each file name corresponds to the nethash, and each file contains the height for milestone activation for that network.

If you are responsible for a network and would like the automatic **Core Bridge** installer to detect the correct height for AIP37 activation, please feel free to submit a pull request for your network to this branch in accordance with the convention described above.
